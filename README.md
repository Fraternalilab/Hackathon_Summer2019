# Hackathon2019 

## Python requirements

- Working Python environment (3.x) that could be provided by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- Working [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) that is [already shipped using Anaconda](https://jupyter.org/install).
- Code editor of your liking, for instance [Atom](https://atom.io/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).

## Coding problems

During the event we will be solving a set of problems with a particular focus on computational biology. The following exercises will cover algorithmic design and automated data analysis tasks. 

These problems will test your algorithmic thinking for which coding solutions can be easily tested.  

__1.__ [**Counting DNA Nucleotides**](./problem-1/README.md)

Count the number nucleotides from a given DNA sequence.

__2.__ [**Calculating Protein Mass**](./problem-2/README.md)

Calculate protein mass from a given protein sequence.

__3.__ [**Finding a Motif in DNA**](./problem-3/README.md)

Find a specific motif within a DNA sequence.

__4.__ [**Rabbits and Recurrence Relations**](./problem-4/README.md)

How many rabbits there are?
